### Artificial Grammar Note Sequence Generator
Used in: Satkunarajah, P., Sauv√©, S.A., & Zendel, B.R. (2023). Tracking the emergence of a pitch hierarchy using an artificial grammar. Frontiers in Cognition.

This custom Python tool generates monophonic note sequences conforming to a user-defined artificial grammar. It was developed to investigate how humans learn hierarchical structure in novel pitch systems through auditory exposure. Key features include:

**Finite-state grammar implementation**: Define transition rules between discrete pitch classes to simulate structured but unfamiliar tonal systems.

**Pseudo-randomized sequence generation**: Create unique sequences that maintain grammatical constraints while minimizing repetition.
